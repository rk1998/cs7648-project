Repo for CS 7648: Interactive Robot Learning Final Project: Applying Active Learning for Sentiment Analysis

This repo contains an implementation for an Active Learning Pipeline that allows a Sentiment Classification Model to learn how to label tweets using a small set of labeled data. 
The pipeline will query a set of unlabeled tweets to be labeled by a human annotator. We experimented with different acquisition functions that determine which tweets will help
the model learn most about the unlabeled dataset.

Implemented a CNN-based Neural Network for Sentiment Classification using pytorch. The original paper for this architecture can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5882.pdf
